<!-- Description of my second job: English Teacher -->
  <h2 id="jobTwo">English Teacher in Shanghai, China: 2005-2007</h2>
<p>When I had a chance to move to China to teach Engish, I jumped on the opportunity. I lived on the campus of a medical college, and fell in love with life in China.</p>

<p>The striking contrast between old an new was unlike anything I had ever seen before.</p>

<!-- Description of my fifth job, Videographer -->
  <h2 id="jobFive">Videographer: 2013-2016</h2>
  <p>During my time as a videographer, I was actually quite negligent with my still camera. The following photos have nothing to do with that job!</p>

  <p>Above: My final vacation as a videographer was to take my wife and then 3-year-old on a cruise.</p>
  <p>Below: This is Trona, California, a town near where I grew up. Science fiction movies requiring unusual and barren landscapes are often shot here.</p>

<!-- Description of my current job, Smorgasbord -->
  <h2 id="jobSix">Gravure Printing Cylinders, 2016-Present</h2>
  <p>I now work at <a href="http://www.yunchengusa.com" target="_blank">American Yuncheng Gravure Cylinder, Inc.</a> in Spartanburg, South Carolina, manufacturing gravure printing cylinders. Yuncheng, headquartered in Shanxi, China, is the largest manufacturer of gravure cylinders in the world.</p>
  <img src="images/aygc-cylinder.jpg" alt="AYGC, Inc.">
  <p>My responsibilities include prepress, customer service, and translation. Due to being bilingual, I sooner or later get involved in most other things that happen in the building.</p>
  <img src="images/aygc.jpg">
  <p>An upcoming responsibility is to build a new website for the company. I believe <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com" target="_blank">DigitalCrafts</a> will be able to help me with that.</p>

  <p>I continue to study Chinese, and have written about my more recent experiences on my blog, "<a href='http://www.hskhacker.com' target="_blank">HSK Hacker</a>."</p>
